# Journal fullstack exercise

## Description

In this exercise, you'll be filling in the missing piece in a simple 
client/backend/database system. 

The environment is orchestrated using docker compose, which currently has the client and
database configurations built in. 

The client is a simple React app that is expecting to get a list of people from the
backend, with a optional search query parameter.

The database is a MySQL database with 2 tables, `people` and `people_colors`
